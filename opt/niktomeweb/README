| Background |
 ------------
Nikto is excellent Scan web server for known vulnerabilities for websites. When performing PTs over large array of IPs in tight deadline, recon must be done as fast as possible via automation.


| Nikto-Me-Web (Automating Nikto from NMap output) |
 ----------------------------------------------------
The Nikto-me-web takes nmap output in Grepable format (-oG) generated together with -sV option.
It extracts all hosts with http & https ports open.
Then it feeds them into ZAP. 

Brendan Coles wrote a similar script in bash which runs whatweb in all ports - https://gist.github.com/798148


| Log Path |
 ----------
Scan results can be found in logs/ folder. Result files are separated per each IP per port with .session and .alerts different folders extension.


| How to configure |
 ------------------
Just run the ZAP tool as a proxy server with on the port 8080 and configured in the zapmeweb.config. You would also have to install zap-cli.
