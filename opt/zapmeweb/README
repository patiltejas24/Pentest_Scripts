ZAP is excellent Vulnerability scanner for websites. When performing PTs over large array of IPs in tight deadline, recon must be done as fast as possible via automation.

The ZAP-me-web takes nmap output in Grepable format (-oG) generated together with -sV option.
It extracts all hosts with http & https ports open.
Then it feeds them into ZAP. 

Brendan Coles wrote a similar script in bash which runs whatweb in all ports - https://gist.github.com/798148
